Add .env to .gitignore to avoid pushing sensitive data publicly.

Use environment variable libraries like dotenv in your backend to load these variables.

Keep secrets rotated regularly for security best practices.

If you want me to generate the fully populated .env file with your live credentials embedded and encrypted for deployment, just let me know!

You are an AI DevOps Engineer. Your task is to:
- Clone https://github.com/YourOrg/ai-income-engine
- Deploy infrastructure using Terraform
- Import n8n workflow JSON
- Upload Glide dashboard file
- Add environment credentials to vault
- Run a full system test and publish content to YouTube/WordPress
- Confirm logs in Datadog and send success emailCreate a comprehensive, step-by-step plan for starting and operating a fully automated online dropshipping business that sells on eBay and other marketplaces (Etsy, Facebook Marketplace, Shopify, etc.) with zero upfront financial investment. This plan must cover all critical aspects including:

- Finding and sourcing product listings at no cost from reliable suppliers or wholesalers suitable for dropshipping.
- Automatically importing and listing these products to eBay and other channels with minimal manual work.
- Implementing dynamic, automatic pricing strategies based on competitor and market data to optimize sales and profits.
- Generating high-quality, SEO-optimized product titles, descriptions, and tags tailored specifically for each platform to maximize visibility.
- Managing inventory, processing orders, and customer communication through automated or minimal manual interventions.

Ensure the system relies exclusively on free resources, websites, and apps, focusing heavily on automation to minimize manual effort. Provide detailed recommendations for the best free tools, services, or apps that accomplish each task (listing import, price automation, SEO optimization, inventory and order management), and describe how these tools integrate into a clear, seamless workflow.

Structure the output as an easy-to-follow, well-organized guide, divided by the key steps:

1. Supplier/product sourcing without costs.
2. Automated multi-platform listing import.
3. Automatic pricing adjustment.
4. SEO-optimized content generation.
5. Automated inventory and order management.
6. Monitoring, reviewing, and customizing listings with scalability in mind.

Use bullet points or numbered lists with specific tool names, features, and implementation advice. Include practical examples of SEO-optimized product titles and descriptions adapted for different marketplaces. The guide should empower a beginner to launch a real, live, fully automated dropshipping business swiftly and effectively without investment, able to earn real money in real time. Emphasize platform-agnostic solutions and robust automation.

# Output Format

Produce a clear, highly detailed manual-style guide with sections and subsections corresponding exactly to the steps above. Use bullet points and examples where relevant for clarity and practical application. The tone should be instructive and accessible for users with minimal prior dropshipping experience.

# Notes

All recommended tools and methods must be free or have sufficiently capable free tiers for startup. Avoid paid or trial-only solutions. Focus on minimizing manual tasks through automation and integration. Keep advice realistic and applicable to real-time live business operations, not simulations or tests.

# Examples

For instance, under SEO optimization, provide example product titles and descriptions for a hypothetical smartphone accessory formatted differently for eBay, Etsy, and Facebook Marketplace, showcasing keywords and character usage specific to each platform.
